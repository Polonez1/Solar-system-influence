# Solar-system-influence
A project about the influence of the solar system on man and Earth
# Abstract

Astrology suggests that planets and other celestial bodies may influence humans. We will examine how celestial bodies interact with humans and the Earth and compare them with objects approximating Earth. We will measure:

- Gravitational Interaction (F) in Newtons according to the Law of Universal Gravitation.
- Radiation Intensity (I) in Watts per square meter (W/m2) - Formula for radiation intensity.

Since astrology lacks a specific description of how and by what means celestial bodies in the solar system influence an individual, let's focus on two parameters. Given that astrology is a broad term, we won't delve into the details of the location of a planet within a particular constellation or which zodiac constellation is in the sky, as stars are too distant to exert any influence not only on an individual but on the entire solar system. The main question pertains to the impact on an individual as a singular object.

Although gravitational influence is meant to measure the force with which celestial bodies attract each other, it is a physical effect that can affect humans. Similarly, electromagnetic radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation, can have a physical impact on humans. Our goal is to demonstrate that the gravitational and electromagnetic effects of other planets on humans are very small and insignificant, making any influence unlikely.

As celestial bodies are highly massive and interact gravitationally with each other, which could potentially influence people on Earth, this is not a direct planetary impact on a specific individual but rather the Earth's influence on the entire human population, which is not related to astrology. As a point of fact, we will consider the average human mass (80kg) and calculate the gravitational influence of celestial bodies on an individual weighing 80kg.
